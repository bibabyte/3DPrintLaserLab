		<h3>Joseph and Biba love to make practical and beautiful things.</h3>

			<div id="names">
				<div id="jos">
				<b>Joseph</b> has been gathering knowledge like a dragon gathers treasure; but instead of hoarding it Jospeh wants to share it with the world. As an artist, a student of philosophy, and a critical thinker, they have collected knowledge from over 100 jobs in addiiton to learning from everyday interactions throughout life. Having had extensive training with lasers and photonics Joseph is merging their technical knowledge with their life-long passion for creating.

				<div id="biba">
				When <b>Biba</b> thinks back, she sees she has alwyas wanted to be a designer. From lavish cakes, to intricate paper snowflakes, to daydreams aobut the clothes and accessories she would make one day. Together with Joseph she decided that 'one day' is now. Her desire to think creatively and keep learning meshes well with being a small business owner becuase there is <i>always</i> something else to learn.
